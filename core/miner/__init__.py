# Miner-specific classes and utilities
# 
# This directory is a placeholder for miner-specific implementations.
# Miners will implement their own pattern detection algorithms here.
#
# The core protocol communication is handled in core/protocol.py
# Miners only need to respond to PatternQuery with DetectedPattern objects.
